    Parameters
    ----------
    solar_elevation: float
        Solar elevation angle in degrees.
    solar_azimuth: float
        Solar azimuth angle in degrees.
    total_collector_geometry: :py:class:`Shapely Polygon <Polygon>`
        Polygon corresponding to the total collector area.
    active_collector_geometry: :py:class:`Shapely Polygon <Polygon>` or :py:class:`MultiPolygon`
        One or more polygons defining the active collector area.
    min_tracker_spacing: float
        Minimum distance between collectors. Used for selecting possible
        shading collectors.
    tracker_distance: array-like
        Distances between neighboring trackers and reference tracker.
    relative_azimuth: array-like
        Relative azimuth between neigboring trackers and reference tracker.
    relative_slope: array-like
        Slope between neighboring trackers and reference tracker. A positive
        slope means neighboring collector is higher than reference collector.
    slope_azimuth : float, optional
        Direction of normal to slope on horizontal [degrees]. Used to determine
        horizon shading.
    slope_tilt : float, default : 0
        Tilt of slope relative to horizontal [degrees]. Used to determine
        horizon shading.
    max_shading_elevation : float, default : 0
        The maximum elevation angle for which shading may occur. Specifying the
        ``max_shading_elevation`` skips the calculations for which the solar
        elevation angle is higher and sets the shaded fraction to zero.
        This reduces the calculation time and results in the same output
        assuming the correct value has been provided.
    plot: bool, default: False
        Whether to plot the projected shadows and unshaded area.
    return_geometries: bool, default: False
        Whether to return the geometries of the unshaded area and the shading
        areas.

    Returns
    -------
    shaded_fraction: float
        Shaded fraction for the specific solar position and field layout.
    geometries: dict
        A dictionary with the keys {'unshaded_geometry', 'shading_geometries'}.
        ``unshaded_geometry`` is a shapely Polygon or MultiPolygon representing
        the unshaded subset of ``active_collector_geometry``.
        ``shading_geometries`` is a list of shapely Polygons representing the
        ``total_collector_geometries`` of neighboring collectors within the
        shaded collector's field of view. Only returned if
        ``return_geometries`` is True.
