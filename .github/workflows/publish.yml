name: Build & Publish package to PyPI

# CI setup instructions:
# 1. Create a new environment for additional protection and security in the GitHub UI:
#    Settings > Environments
#    Name: release
# 2. Setup trusted publishing for the release environment:
#    https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/
# 3. Ensure your main development branch is named 'main'; if not, update the workflow or rename the branch

# This workflow is triggered on pull requests that target the main branch
# on pushes to the main branch new tags that start with 'v' (for example, 'v1.0.0').
# Only the main branch is used for publishing to PyPI, in the second job.
